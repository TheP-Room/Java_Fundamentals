            artifacts is collection/assembly of all our project assets that we
             put together

            find artifacts under project structure section and class and build using
             build artifacts option

            module is another level of abstraction above packages

            to run jar files use "java -jar file.jar"
            here java command executes the jvm (java virtual machine)
